CURRENTLY ON:
 * Mining fluid required randomizer?
 * Make unified things more user friendly (final pass)
 * Test for hidden items/recipes in logic (I think it doesn't do tests now)
 * Add full tests for unified handlers
 * More safeguards

 * (30min) Refactoring lookups (then push commit about refactoring)
 * (a few hours?) Handlers, I.B.1, probably will take at least this week, entity randomization as a bonus
 * (more hours) Finish I.B, finish by the 25th

Big picture is working with 0.5.0 and unified randomization migration first. Then going on to dupes, possibly brainstorming ways to reduce the roughness (potentially adding more limits/a limits setting).
Not sure whether to keep pushing with unified and first pass sort right after that.
