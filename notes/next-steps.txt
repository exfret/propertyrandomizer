CURRENTLY ON:
 * Limits/presets
    * Decide whether I should keep the old or new algorithm

Big picture is working with 0.5.0 and unified randomization migration first. Then going on to dupes, possibly brainstorming ways to reduce the roughness (potentially adding more limits/a limits setting).
Not sure whether to keep pushing with unified and first pass sort right after that.
