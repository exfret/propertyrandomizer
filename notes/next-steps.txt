CURRENTLY ON:
 * System for configuring handlers better, flag which ones I needed to make assumptions for
    * This is motivated by the need for seeing which randomizations are vanilla-specific
    * Test that the blacklist I set up is working
 * Spoofs for spoilage handler
    * Spoofs for fluid operation too!
 * Make unified things more user friendly (final pass)
 * Test for hidden items/recipes in logic (I think it doesn't do tests now)

 * (30min) Refactoring lookups (then push commit about refactoring)
 * (a few hours?) Handlers, I.B.1, probably will take at least this week, entity randomization as a bonus
 * (more hours) Finish I.B, finish by the 25th

Big picture is working with 0.5.0 and unified randomization migration first. Then going on to dupes, possibly brainstorming ways to reduce the roughness (potentially adding more limits/a limits setting).
Not sure whether to keep pushing with unified and first pass sort right after that.
