CURRENTLY ON:
 * Make unified things more user friendly (final pass)
    * Figure out why technologies are getting only early science packs (especially when things are delinearized)
 * Test for hidden items/recipes in logic (I think it doesn't do tests now)
 * Add full tests for with unified handlers
 * More safeguards
    * Go through orb and dosh run to see what needs to be changed
 * Fail on softlocks during testing (and perhaps also on prereq shuffle failures by searching for % or something)

Big picture is working with 0.5.0 and unified randomization migration first. Then going on to dupes, possibly brainstorming ways to reduce the roughness (potentially adding more limits/a limits setting).
Not sure whether to keep pushing with unified and first pass sort right after that.
