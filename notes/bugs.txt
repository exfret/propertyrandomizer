1. Shotgun shells show -100% damage (I think this is fixed)
7. Mining drill offsets can be inside machine
16. Module effects should guarantee at least some prod/quality/etc./be more balanced in general
27. Some items show the "combustible" tooltip twice in their description (probably the fault of graph item rando combining with item fuel rando?)

2. Assembling machines don't follow upgrade line randomization due to having different crafting categories, so need to be manually linked together
5. Biter eggs are reported to be reachable when they aren't (probably a problem with logic/dependency graph) (https://mods.factorio.com/mod/propertyrandomizer/discussion/6935501854f0ff3c23623425)
6. Item rando is giving very large result amounts (got over 65k limit on result amount)
8. Item rando doesn't properly update icons
10. Compatibility issue involving item rando with wood fuel values and K2SO (https://mods.factorio.com/mod/propertyrandomizer/discussion/6949ca01f6fd1af9b2f36a03)
11. Compatibility issue with merging chest mod and item_to_place sizes (https://mods.factorio.com/mod/propertyrandomizer/discussion/69430dcb60cb530c95eac2d2)
13. Incompatibility with pacifist mod (https://mods.factorio.com/mod/propertyrandomizer/discussion/6921e8f843b1eb2c5cef559f)
14. Duplicates crashes editor extensions (https://mods.factorio.com/mod/propertyrandomizer/discussion/6911fe1136382d1ea1ae0764)
17. Rocket launch time randomization was causing the silo to not build the rocket
18. EdwardR reporting thrusters behind other planets' trigger techs
21. Tree seed drop/recycle rates making them unsustainable
      * Caused by all of recipe ingredient amounts and result amounts and probability rando, which I'd be fine disabling, but also could be caused by mining results rando, showing this is a deeper issue
      * Essentially, we need to ignore planted entities just like we ignore built entities and resources for mining results, and I'm not even sure what to do about the recipe amounts rando
22. Make sure spitters can't outrange everything
26. Add quality testing (mainly for ItemIDFilter types in trigger techs from mods)
25. Some tooltip and description-y stuff should be moved to locale rather than hardcoded
26. Allow asteroid resistances and all damage type randomizations again once softlocks are worked out

Requests
1. Regenerating seed more quickly (rerolling automatically)
2. Blacklisting items/prototypes for certain randomizations
3. Better clamps on the new numerical randomizations with lower than ultimate chaos

Fixed?
12. Change corpse size doesn't check that there is a corpse first, resulting in mod incompatibilities (https://mods.factorio.com/mod/propertyrandomizer/discussion/69224af08e1629a0efaa7d67)
19. Clamping needed on day length reduction randomization (-100% day length nauvis resulting in potential epilepsy risk)
20. Return to nauvis giving control stage error in multiplayer
23. Account for tables for research triggers in building graph/logic
9. Solar panels require for space platform randomized to be too heavy to launch (might be fixed with new logic that accounts for weights)
28. Weight randomization tooltips should be more specific
24. Change name for "mining time" randomization to "pickup time"
25. Mining drill radius too small (1x1 bleh)
15. Asteroid resistances can result in softlocks
