1. Shotgun shells show -100% damage (I think this is fixed)
2. Assembling machines don't follow upgrade line randomization due to having different crafting categories, so need to be manually linked together
5. Biter eggs are reported to be reachable when they aren't (probably a problem with logic/dependency graph) (https://mods.factorio.com/mod/propertyrandomizer/discussion/6935501854f0ff3c23623425)
6. Item rando is giving very large result amounts (got over 65k limit on result amount)
7. Mining drill offsets can be inside machine
8. Item rando doesn't properly update icons
9. Solar panels require for space platform randomized to be too heavy to launch (might be fixed with new logic that accounts for weights)
10. Compatibility issue involving item rando with wood fuel values and K2SO (https://mods.factorio.com/mod/propertyrandomizer/discussion/6949ca01f6fd1af9b2f36a03)
11. Compatibility issue with merging chest mod and item_to_place sizes (https://mods.factorio.com/mod/propertyrandomizer/discussion/69430dcb60cb530c95eac2d2)
12. Change corpse size doesn't check that there is a corpse first, resulting in mod incompatibilities (https://mods.factorio.com/mod/propertyrandomizer/discussion/69224af08e1629a0efaa7d67)
13. Incompatibility with pacifist mod (https://mods.factorio.com/mod/propertyrandomizer/discussion/6921e8f843b1eb2c5cef559f)
14. Duplicates crashes editor extensions (https://mods.factorio.com/mod/propertyrandomizer/discussion/6911fe1136382d1ea1ae0764)
15. Asteroid resistances can result in softlocks
16. Module effects should guarantee at least some prod/quality/etc./be more balanced in general
17. Rocket launch time randomization was causing the silo to not build the rocket
18. EdwardR reporting thrusters behind other planets' trigger techs
19. Clamping needed on day length reduction randomization (-100% day length nauvis resulting in potential epilepsy risk)
20. Return to nauvis giving control stage error in multiplayer
21. Tree seed drop/recycle rates making them unsustainable
22. Make sure spitters can't outrange everything
      * Caused by all of recipe ingredient amounts and result amounts and probability rando, which I'd be fine disabling, but also could be caused by mining results rando, showing this is a deeper issue
      * Essentially, we need to ignore planted entities just like we ignore built entities and resources for mining results, and I'm not even sure what to do about the recipe amounts rando
23. Account for tables for research triggers in building graph/logic
24. Change name for "mining time" randomization to "pickup time"
25. Mining drill radius too small (1x1 bleh)

Requests
1. Regenerating seed more quickly (rerolling automatically)
2. Blacklisting items/prototypes for certain randomizations
3. Better clamps on the new numerical randomizations with lower than ultimate chaos
