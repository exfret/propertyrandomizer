Edited spoilage handler, identified core issue; all_contexts_reachable had been changed to rely on slot and trav owners rather than the slots/travs themselves to overcome a shortcoming somewhere else. This was reverted, and things worked afterward. I also added a small test that a trav always comes after its slot. I will later need to actually fix whatever was previously relying on the slot/trav-owners instead of slot/travs directly (the comment mentioned due to doing direct connections, I think this was something I did while desperately trying to get first pass working).

Next steps are to continue with handler implementation, with science pack rando a key target.
