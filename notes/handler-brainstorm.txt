Huge
  * Recipe ingredients
  * Recipe results
  * Recipe categories (ignore multi-categories for now)
  * Item rando (with fluids now)

Big
  * Item spoiling (spoofs so that which items spoil and what they spoil into are both changed)

Medium
  * Technology prerequisites
  * Technology science pack sets
  * Technology unlocks (not just recipes)
  * Technology triggers (things can become triggers or become science-pack based, also spoof new triggers)
  * Item to entity spoil result
  * Item fuel categories
  * Item burnt results (spoof so both source and destination can change)

Small
  * Tile to fluid produced (won't impact vanilla much until first pass is up and going)
  * Machine input/output fluids (boiler, fusion reactor, etc.), this might be able to be done with two handlers
  * Resource mining fluid (spoofs to allow more/fewer resources to need fluid too)


Unsure about/not yet:
  * Mining results
    - Seems like it conflicts with item rando, and doesn't add too much for its level of balancing complexity
    - I want to see if I can get it to work, but this is a later problem when I think of smarter ways to do this
    - Includes plant/asteroid collector rando
  * Item rando on buildings
    - ex.- oil refineries could "take the place" of a centrifuge instead
    - I need to think a lot about this to get it to work, but it could be great
  * Room to entity surface conditions
    - Can't change context yet I think
  * Resources to resource categories
    - Not a well-explored enough mechanic in vanilla to be worth my time yet
  * Energy source types
    - I can just go random but something feels unfulfilliing with that and there must be some better way
  * Ammo categories
    - Need to figure out way to do it and yet still ensure starting turrets without hardcoding
  * Asteroid spawns
    - High softlock potential and not many new combinations to experience
  * Planet/space-connection map
    - A small thing with lots of complexity that's not worth figuring out yet
  * A bunch of planet --> X connections
    - As already mentioned, not changing context yet
    - Things like lightning, heatings, tiles, surface conditions
  * A bunch of smaller/not worth right now things like equipment
  * Entity loot
    - Not really used in vanilla
  * Machine recipe categories
  * Which resources require fluids (not many possibilities yet)
  * Plant results
  * Resources per planet/autoplace in general?
  * Silly: Item launched? You launch something and it turns into something else on the way down
  * On that note, base game rocket launch results
