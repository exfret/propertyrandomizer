A plan of when to complete new features I think of, along with the stages of the randomizer I've completed (see next-steps.txt).

I. Unified rando
    A. DONE
    B. In progress
        * Entity randomization (in master branch first)
        * Prereq shuffle versions of item/entity rando to fit into prereq rando
        * Unified randomizations:
            1. (DONE) Tech prereqs
            2. (DONE) Recipe tech unlocks
            3. (In Progress) Recipe categories
            4. (DONE) Spoiling (what spoils and into what)
            5. Fuel categories
            6. Entity rando
            7. Tile fluids, machine input/output fluids, mining fluids
            8. (DONE) Technology science pack sets
        * Basic spoofing, plan in when/what other spoofing to do later
        * Flow cost checks
        * Build graph compat nodes added to new logic
        (No working surface rando yet, to be done in IV)
        (No ingredient/result rando, was just for testing with surfaces, no official/balanced item rando since already done)
        (No burnt result rando yet due to payoff/reward)
        (No surface randomizations, do those when finishing isolatability)
II. Dupes/group unlocks
    A.
        * Dupes with better graphics (might need to ping Osmo)
        * Reorganize logic and lookup
        * Testing script for releases and seed testing
    B.
        * Bundled randomizations (brainstorm and prototype), maybe do with numerical too?
        * Remove hardcoding, move the rest of this to later as needed
III. Brainstorm
    A.
        * Contexts writeup (short), slot scramble writeup (others optional; they seem clear enough)
        * General reorganization/refactoring
    B.
        * Finish isolatability, check ammo only in space and spaceship nodes from other planets as goal (not balancing yet, just partial)
        * Basic performance improvements
        * Prereq pool basic preservation
    C.
        * Scoured numerical randomizations list
        * Misc. bonus randomizations
            1. Item/fluid switching rando
            2. Energy source rando
            3. Re-add some military randomizations, separate into new setting?
IV. Full pass improvements
    A.
        * Extra limits based on chaos (maybe tied to config rather than a direct chaos check within code)
    B.
        * Full recipe ingredient rando import
        * Flow cost coproduct split (comparison with simplex)
        * The big merge
    C.
        * Chaos factors into unified randomizations (displacement shuffle)
    D.
        * Pass through TODO's, address critical ones
        * Graphics and localisation/UI improvements for reflections
V. Limited configuration
    A.
        * Prototype-wise blacklists
        * Better/configurable logging, profiling
    B.
        * "Balance level" setting
        * Retries setting
        * Way to save settings (not full data.raw, just mod settings)
VI. Limited compatibility
    A.
        * Light guaranteed compatibility with certain QOL mods
    B.
        * Add automatic tests for compat to release testing script
VII. Completeness
    A.
        * Create roadmap to 1.0, assuming I'm still going (hopefully here by end of spring quarter?)
    B.
        * More bonus randomizations
            1. Collision mask rando
            2. Evolution levels/biter spawns
    C.
        * Watch the world burn mode
        * Planetary duplication, creation of new randomized planets
VIII. Polish
    A.
    B.
        * Final pass through TODO's, remove outdated ones
        * Github README/summaries
    C.
        * Tool for generating override settings in-game
    D.
        * Overhaul compatibility
    E.
    F. (Testing playthrough)
    G. (Tweaks)
IX. Release
    A. (Slot for extras)
    B. (Slot for extras)
    C. (Slot for extras)
    D. (Slot for extras)
X. Maintenance
