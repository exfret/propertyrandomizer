WORKING ON:
 - DONE Finish README about spec/overrides
 - DONE Work on recipe randomization
 - Some balancing as detailed in notes
 - Dupes
 - Misc. randomizations that I need to go back to, like modules
 - New randomizations
 - Space age randomizations
 - Technology/a few other graph-based randomizations now
 - Maybe look over TODO's one last time
 - Improve dependency graph
 - Basic tests

2. Check that only allowed settings are passed into randnum
3. Rounding after rescalings
8. Blacklists?
10. Beacon profiles?
11. Whether to randomize radar ranges of roboports/cargo landing pads along with radar range randomization?
12. Combat robot damage?
13. Evolution levels?
15. Worm sticker slowdown and yumako speedup (separate?)
16. Work on recipe randomization more?
17. Roboport input buffer recharge rate
18. Clamp end result to the hard min/max range in case it escaped outside
19. Why is supply area for electric poles only working for substations?
20. Make sure to set localised string for power pole reach in the fixes due to it being modified there
21. Ore swap randomization
22. Make rocket turrets an aquilo dependency in build-graph-compat

DONE:
9. Retrieve projectiles to randomize damage on those
7. Pollutant types for pollution randomization
5. Finish linked randomization on certain randomizations that I need to finish it on
4. Round cooldowns correctly (need to specify rounding none property as well)
1. Check over balancing params again
6. Configuration code

NO LONGER APPLICABLE:
14. Maybe print a note about flib being required now?
