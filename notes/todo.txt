WORKING ON:
 - Dupes (hard mode version)
   * First, work on items, like resources
   * Then, uplicate techs a lot
   * Tech unlocks
 - Mechanics randomization
   * Check if game is possible after mechanics randomization and print to console
   * Recipe tech unlock rando
   * Fix localisation with dupe and item randomization

 - Look into rocket launch time bug
 - Look into cliff size bug?

Bigger things:
 - Various numerical/space age especially randomizations need adding
 - Tech unlock randomization
 - Tech packs required randomization
 - Dupes
 - Misc. randomizations that I need to go back to, like cliffs
 - New randomizations
 - Space age randomizations
 - Maybe look over TODO's one last time
 - Item-fluid randomization?

3. Rounding after rescalings
8. Blacklists?
10. Beacon profiles?
12. Combat robot damage?
13. Evolution levels?
15. Worm sticker slowdown and yumako speedup (separate?)
17. Roboport input buffer recharge rate
18. Clamp end result to the hard min/max range in case it escaped outside
19. Why is supply area for electric poles only working for substations?
20. Make sure to set localised string for power pole reach in the fixes due to it being modified there
23. Automatability nodes
24. Add build_graph_compat nodes to Obsidian spec
25. Check if node-transport-item-to-surface actually needs to also rely on the corresponding planet-launch
26. Double check thruster fuel always made on a space surface
27. *** Make sure ammo is craftable on space platform
28. Increase time cost for recipe randomization?
29. Add more safeguards against bad accesses/nodes from mods in dependency graph
30. Make sure spitters can't outrange *everything*
31. Add space platform starter packs to list of not randomized
32. Bullets blacklist from trees
33. Rocket launch time bug (seems to get stuck with certain launch times? See mod page)
34. Biter pathing bad when they're large
35. Lots of things behind military science - tech randomization
36. Clarify dropdowns for logistics etc. are number of different randomizations, not amount of randomization
37. Check fulgorite possible softlock (or maybe it has to do with scrap recycling)
38. Randomize trigger effects?
39. Fallback recipes approach? With recycling? Like in autotech
40. Buildings don't spoil quickly
41. Value-aware coproduct split... use already-determined costs for things to distribute value among recipe results when there's more than one result
42. Fix localised keys for technologies with -number format
43. Fix rocket capacity propagating and making everything hard to fill a rocket
44. Look up "broken new capsule" bug
45. Require planetary science pack recipes to use space resource
46. Critical TODO

DONE:
16. Work on recipe randomization more
21. Ore swap randomization
22. Make rocket turrets an aquilo dependency in build-graph-compat
24. Items keep fuel value in item randomization (add random fuels later mayhaps)
2. Check that only allowed settings are passed into randnum
9. Retrieve projectiles to randomize damage on those
7. Pollutant types for pollution randomization
5. Finish linked randomization on certain randomizations that I need to finish it on
4. Round cooldowns correctly (need to specify rounding none property as well)
1. Check over balancing params again
6. Configuration code

NOT DOING/NO LONGER APPLICABLE:
11. Whether to randomize radar ranges of roboports/cargo landing pads along with radar range randomization
14. Maybe print a note about flib being required now?
