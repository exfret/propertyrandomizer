WORKING ON:
 - Dupes!
    - No wait!! First, unified randomization!

 - Speed up find_valid_prereq_list in recipe ings randomization by not checking items/fluids multiple times if necessary
 - Add tooltip info for new randomizations (check diffs to confirm which ones are new)
 - Back to ammo preservation
 - Then, maybe recipe rando changes based on chaos
 - Also maybe "bundled" randomization where some things get randomized together for a consistent "story"
 - Planetary randomization
   * Check if game is possible after planetary randomization and print to console
   * Fix localisation with dupe and item randomization
 - Allow item randomization to apply to some fluids? If it does, just give the item's effects to the barrel
 - Dupes with better graphics (use artisinal reskins?)

 - Look into rocket launch time bug

Bigger things:
 - Various numerical/space age especially randomizations need adding
 - Tech packs required randomization
 - Dupes
 - Misc. randomizations that I need to go back to, like cliffs
 - New randomizations
 - Space age randomizations
 - Maybe look over TODO's one last time
 - Item-fluid randomization?
 - Make sure one of each "category" is good
 - Make default behavior less unhinged (and high chaos more unhinged)
 - Randomize things in groups: all ores lower stack size for example, one master roll, not just random for each
 - Topological sort with caveats

Ideas from Nifyr (not necessarily good ones):
 - Randomize recipe crafting categories
 - Randomize crafting machine crafting categories
 - Randomize energy source type for agricultural towers, boilers, crafting machines, inserters, labs, mining drills
    offshore pumps, pumps, radars and reactors
 - Randomize energy source type for ammo turrets, asteroid collectors, beacons, combinators, electric turrets,
    inventory bonus equipment, lamps, programmable speakers and roboports (can be electric or void/nil)
 - Randomize energy source type for cars, generator equipment, locomotives, roboport equipment and spider vehicles
    (can be burner or void/nil)
 - Randomize fuel categories for burners
 - Randomize ammo categories per ammo, gun and ammo turret prototypes
 - Randomize input and output fluids of boiler prototypes, perhaps by treating it as a recipe in recipe randomizer?
 - Randomize input fluid of generator prototypes
 - Randomize input fluid of fusion reactor prototypes + output fluid of fusion generator prototypes
 - Randomize output fluid of fusion reactor prototypes + input fluid of fusion generator prototypes? Treat them like recipes?
    Make plasma part of recipe randomization?
 - Randomize which resources require fluid to mine + which fluid per resource. Treat as recipes?
 - Randomize which items spoil + spoil results. Treat as recipes?
 - Randomize which fuels have burnt results and which burnt result per fuel. Treat as recipes?
 - Randomize mining results of plants. Treat seed -> plant result as recipe?
 - Randomize fuel and oxidizer fluids for thrusters
 - Randomize asteroid spawns per space location and space connection
 - Randomize the planet-space connection graph (the space map)
 - Randomize which item and fluid resources appear on each planet
 - Randomize which entities appear on each planet
 - Randomize which planets have lightning
 - Randomize fluid tiles per planet or fluid per fluid tile

3. Rounding after rescalings
8. Blacklists?
12. Combat robot damage?
13. Evolution levels?
15. Worm sticker slowdown and yumako speedup (separate?)
17. Roboport input buffer recharge rate
18. Clamp end result to the hard min/max range in case it escaped outside
19. Why is supply area for electric poles only working for substations?
20. Make sure to set localised string for power pole reach in the fixes due to it being modified there
 - Nifyr commented out this fix under the impression that it wasn't necessary
23. Automatability nodes
24. Add build_graph_compat nodes to Obsidian spec
25. Check if node-transport-item-to-surface actually needs to also rely on the corresponding planet-launch
26. Double check thruster fuel always made on a space surface
27. *** Make sure ammo is craftable on space platform
28. Increase time cost for recipe randomization?
29. Add more safeguards against bad accesses/nodes from mods in dependency graph
30. Make sure spitters can't outrange *everything*
31. Add space platform starter packs to list of not randomized
32. Bullets blacklist from trees
33. Rocket launch time bug (seems to get stuck with certain launch times? See mod page)
34. Biter pathing bad when they're large
35. Lots of things behind military science - tech randomization
36. Clarify dropdowns for logistics etc. are number of different randomizations, not amount of randomization
37. Check fulgorite possible softlock (or maybe it has to do with scrap recycling)
38. Randomize trigger effects?
39. Fallback recipes approach? With recycling? Like in autotech
40. Buildings don't spoil quickly
41. Value-aware coproduct split... use already-determined costs for things to distribute value among recipe results when there's more than one result
42. Fix localised keys for technologies with -number format
43. Fix rocket capacity propagating and making everything hard to fill a rocket
44. Look up "broken new capsule" bug
45. Require planetary science pack recipes to use space resources
46. Critical TODO
47. Prevent wood on trees, or at least make less likely since it's boring
48. More limits by default
49. Things unlocked in groups? Like, things for bots unlocked all at once
50. Icon bugs (seems to just be with dupes mode)
51. Electric mining drill fluid softlock (need to check that there is a mining drill that *can* mine with fluid)
52. Allow different sort of topological sort orders? Right now it's just arbitrary right?
53. Rename +pollution tooltip to "emissions"
56. Less scattered unlocks (so you don't have to hunt a hundred different places for the components of something that you've already unlocked)
57. Think of ways to do non-rectangular buildings
58. Allow for nonlinear sorts (limits randomization, but also prevents progression blocking)
59. Figure out a way to randomize past "required" nodes
60. Forward fill could put solar panels first, so use that perhaps for item randomization
61. Surface condition randomization
62. Randomized settings setting
63. Allow backtracking/more attempts with item (maybe also recipe) randomization, add as a setting with note that load times may be slow

DONE:
55. Make the topological sort random
10. Beacon profiles
54. No infinite load times with recipe randomization
16. Work on recipe randomization more
21. Ore swap randomization
22. Make rocket turrets an aquilo dependency in build-graph-compat
24. Items keep fuel value in item randomization (add random fuels later mayhaps)
2. Check that only allowed settings are passed into randnum
9. Retrieve projectiles to randomize damage on those
7. Pollutant types for pollution randomization
5. Finish linked randomization on certain randomizations that I need to finish it on
4. Round cooldowns correctly (need to specify rounding none property as well)
1. Check over balancing params again
6. Configuration code

NOT DOING/NO LONGER APPLICABLE:
11. Whether to randomize radar ranges of roboports/cargo landing pads along with radar range randomization
14. Maybe print a note about flib being required now?
