This is a file for smaller todos (see next-steps.txt for master plan and features.txt for bigger plans)
For bugs/fixes rather than features, see bugs.txt

 * Check on tooltips for new randomizations
 * Misc. rando for starting gun, starting ammo (and amount), and crashed spacheship contents/starting inventory
 * Account for ability to move around on planets in logic (need ice platforms on Aquilo), maybe just a compat on ice platforms etc.?
 * Branched randomization; military part of tech tree being separate for example (might make randomization process too sensitive)
 * Add fulgorite to logic
 * Spoiling checks on buildings (make sure it's not too quick)
 * Fill in weights before graph randos
 * Force space resources in appropriate places (like planetary science packs)
 * Randomized top sorts in new sorts (make random preferred order and sort according to that?)
 * Address recipe tech unlock scattering with bubbling
 * Randomized settings setting
 * Think about possibility/helpfulness of backtracking?
 * Softlock checking based on "concrete" nodes, better error messages for softlocks
 * Add recipetweaker to list of recommended mods, and consider other "tweaker" mods
 * Think about secondary sort rando (doing a second sort and taking intersection to reduce linearity)
 * Check heating_energy when checking whether things can freeze (zero means it can't freeze)
 * Document that ability to mine fluid ("uranium mining") is researched from start
 * Limits setting
    * Go through orb and dosh run to see what needs to be changed with regards to limitation
 * Lead player toward more normal presets
 * Tech trigger handler
 * Presets to guide player away from "ultimate chaos"
 * Fail on softlocks during testing (and perhaps also on prereq shuffle failures by searching for % or something)
 * Add full tests for with unified handlers
 * Randomize background music
