CURRENTLY ON:
 * entity-operation-fluid handler (keep a test-centered focus)
    * Add some invariants for node deps always being an edge!
 * Tests! I'm tired of not knowing if things are working
    * Work on concurrently with spoilage handler to help with diagnosis of the issue
 * Entity rando in main branch
    * Refactoring out into multiple files
    * Add any new node types needed
    * The algorithm proper

 * (30min) Refactoring lookups (then push commit about refactoring)
 * (a few hours?) Handlers, I.B.1, probably will take at least this week, entity randomization as a bonus
 * (more hours) Finish I.B, finish by the 25th

This is a file for smaller todos (see next-steps.txt for master plan and features.txt for bigger plans)
For bugs/fixes rather than features, see bugs.txt

 * Check on tooltips for new randomizations
 * Re-implement color randomization
 * Misc. rando for starting gun, starting ammo (and amount), and crashed spacheship contents/starting inventory
 * Account for ability to move around on planets in logic (need ice platforms on Aquilo), maybe just a compat on ice platforms etc.?
 * Branched randomization; military part of tech tree being separate for example (might make randomization process too sensitive)
 * Add fulgorite to logic
 * Spoiling checks on buildings (make sure it's not too quick)
 * Fill in weights before graph randos
 * Force space resources in appropriate places (like planetary science packs)
 * Randomized top sorts in new sorts (make random preferred order and sort according to that?)
 * Address recipe tech unlock scattering with bubbling
 * Randomized settings setting
 * Think about possibility/helpfulness of backtracking?
 * Softlock checking based on "concrete" nodes, better error messages for softlocks
 * Add recipetweaker to list of recommended mods, and consider other "tweaker" mods
 * Think about secondary sort rando (doing a second sort and taking intersection to reduce linearity)
 * Check heating_energy when checking whether things can freeze (zero means it can't freeze)
