Ideas from Nifyr (not necessarily good ones):
 - Randomize recipe crafting categories
 - Randomize crafting machine crafting categories
 - Randomize energy source type for agricultural towers, boilers, crafting machines, inserters, labs, mining drills
    offshore pumps, pumps, radars and reactors
 - Randomize energy source type for ammo turrets, asteroid collectors, beacons, combinators, electric turrets,
    inventory bonus equipment, lamps, programmable speakers and roboports (can be electric or void/nil)
 - Randomize energy source type for cars, generator equipment, locomotives, roboport equipment and spider vehicles
    (can be burner or void/nil)
 - Randomize fuel categories for burners
 - Randomize ammo categories per ammo, gun and ammo turret prototypes
 - Randomize input and output fluids of boiler prototypes, perhaps by treating it as a recipe in recipe randomizer?
 - Randomize input fluid of generator prototypes
 - Randomize input fluid of fusion reactor prototypes + output fluid of fusion generator prototypes
 - Randomize output fluid of fusion reactor prototypes + input fluid of fusion generator prototypes? Treat them like recipes?
    Make plasma part of recipe randomization?
 - Randomize which resources require fluid to mine + which fluid per resource. Treat as recipes?
 - Randomize which items spoil + spoil results. Treat as recipes?
 - Randomize which fuels have burnt results and which burnt result per fuel. Treat as recipes?
 - Randomize mining results of plants. Treat seed -> plant result as recipe?
 - Randomize fuel and oxidizer fluids for thrusters
 - Randomize asteroid spawns per space location and space connection
 - Randomize the planet-space connection graph (the space map)
 - Randomize which item and fluid resources appear on each planet
 - Randomize which entities appear on each planet
 - Randomize which planets have lightning
 - Randomize fluid tiles per planet or fluid per fluid tile
