Name: "Watch the world burn"

Description for setting?

Sets chaos to ultimate, adds tons of duplicates for a longer game, and turns on every randomization. Also includes a couple... "tweaks". Takes precedence over all below settings. Not necessarily compatible with mods other than Space Age, or with those who are faint of heart.


Everything is duped, not just important stuff
Everything has extra ingredients and results
Some other things

This could be a setting for extra capsule actions and other custom stuff
We could add a dummy iron ore, and later replace wherever it is with real iron ore, but this would at least give the chance to get more starter patches without needing new items (similar idea to recipe ingredients)
Extra planets
