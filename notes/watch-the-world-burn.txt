Name: "Watch the world burn"

Description for setting?

Sets chaos to ultimate, adds tons of duplicates for a longer game, and turns on every randomization. Also includes a couple... "tweaks". Takes precedence over all below settings. Not necessarily compatible with mods other than Space Age, or with those who are faint of heart.


Everything is duped, not just important stuff
Everything has extra ingredients and results
