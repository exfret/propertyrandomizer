type: OR

There is one of these per surface.

Prereqs:
- The [[node-operate-entity-surface]] of any burner generator
- The [[node-operate-entity-surface]] of any fluid generator (like a steam engine)
- The [[node-operate-entity-surface]] of any lightning collector, if this is a surface with lightning
- The [[node-operate-entity-surface]] of any solar panel
- The [[node-operate-entity-surface]] of a fusion generator on this surface (this is somewhat redundant since fusion reactors require electricity to start up anyways)
