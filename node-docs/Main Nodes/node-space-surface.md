One of these per SurfacePrototype. We assume that if a surface can be made somewhere, it can be made or transported anywhere, or at least that it isn't required for progression to be made at two different places where it can be created at one but not the other.

Prereqs:
- The [[node-create-space-platform-tech-unlock]]
- The corresponding [[node-send-surface-starter-pack]]
