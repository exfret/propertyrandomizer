One per recipe category-surface pair. This is separate from recipe-category-surface for potential help in determining when something is automatable. There are also extra duplicates for whenever we also need extra constraints, like an assembling machine with fluid connections as well (this essentially becomes its own category).

Prereqs:
- Any [[node-operate-entity-surface]] for a machine capable of producing this recipe category on this surface
