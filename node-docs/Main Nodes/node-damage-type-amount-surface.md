description: Access to ability to apply a certain damage type in certain quantities (on a specific surface). Multiple of these can even exist for the same damage type for enemies that regenerate too fast for low amounts of damage to feasibly kill them.
type: OR

There is a custom number of these nodes, depending on what is judged as the appropriate levels of damage types and amounts.

Prereqs:
- A [[node-gun-ammo-surface]] dealing enough damage
- A [[node-operate-entity-surface]] for a laser turret dealing enough damage placeable on this surface
- A [[node-item]] representing a capsule, like a grenade, that does enough damage
- A [[node-character]] with a melee attack that's strong enough
- A [[node-operate-entity]] that has large enough impact damage, for which the impact damage is feasibly a primary source of damage
