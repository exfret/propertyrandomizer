Note: Extras is for things that I could also randomize in to make the process smoother. Not all of them would be in a given game.

Only stuff that I think would make sense to go off-nauvis is put in the nauvis category.

I could also have some special buildings be placeable on multiple planets

1. Aquilo
	1. Ammonical ocean
		1. Comes with ammonia, the thing that takes the place of fluorine might need to be randomized
		2. Also comes with ice tiles
	2. Captive biter spawner (recipe)
		1. This is just for the recipe
	3. Crude oil patch
		1. This could become another fluid patch
	4. Efficient rocket fuel/solid fuel recipe
		2. This could use a different ingredient
	5. Fluorine
		3. Also need to randomize in a spot for it to be used if it's not with the ammonia
	6. Foundation (tech unlock)
		4. Would need to modify the ingredients if it's unlocked earlier
	7. Freezing
		5. Wouldn't get randomized to Nauvis, I could randomize with ice terrain?
	8. Fusion power
		6. Would also need to switch around fusion fuels and such
	9. Lithium
		8. May also need to swap out processing that involves holmium plates for something else
	10. Quantum processor
		9. The intermediate would be made elsewhere
	11. Railgun (tech unlock)
		10. Would also need to randomize 
2. Fulgora
	1. Better equipment
		1. Grouping the three new equipments here so that they will get randomized together)
	2. Electromagenetic plant
		1. Would need to switch recipes around
	3. Holmium
	4. Lightning
		1. Lightning collector craftable from nauvis, so this is fine
	5. Mech armor (recipe unlock)
	6. Oilsands
		1. Not sure how to randomize the actual "islands" sort of mechanic?
	7. Quality module 3
	8. Scrap
		2. Where scrap is, may have to unlock recycler somewhere else
	9. Tesla turret
3. Gleba
	1. Bacteria
	2. Biochamber
		1. Might need to change recipe if it doesn't come with pentapod eggs
		2. Also comes with bio-recipes
	3. Bioflux farming
		1. This includes bioflux, yumako, and jellynut, plus the agricultural tower
	4. Biolab
	5. Capture robots
	6. Cliffs (Gleba style)
	7. Efficiency module 3
	8. Extra stone patch
	9. Heating tower
	10. Pentapods
		1. Come with pentapod eggs too
	11. Productivity module 3
	12. Rocket turret
	13. Shallow water
	14. Spidertron
	15. Stack inserter
	16. Toolbelt Equipment
4. Nauvis
	1. Big rocks (nauvis)
	2. Biters?
		1. Would also include their eggs, not sure of whether to go through with this one since any other enemies would be OP
	3. Biolabs (ability to place them)
	4. Electric energy distribution 2
	5. Elevated rails
	6. First coal patches
		1. The starter coal patch still always spawns and has an infinite core
	7. First copper patches
		1. The starter copper patch still always spawns and has an infinite core
	8. First crude oil
		1. There is still a crude oil that starts nearby
	9. First iron patches
		1. The starter iron patch still always spawns and has an infinite core
	10. First stone patch
		1. The starter stone patch still always spawns and has an infinite core
	11. Fish breeding
	12. Kovarex enrichment process
	13. Landfill
	14. Production science pack?
	15. Uranium ammo tech
	16. Uranium patch
	17. Utility science pack?
	18. Nauvis water
		1. The starter lake still always spawns
	19. Wood processing
5. Vulcanus
	1. Artillery
	2. Asteroid reprocessing (tech)
	3. Big mining drill
		1. Will need to alter recipe and what mbuilding it's made in obviously
	4. Big rocks (vulcanus)
	5. Calcite
		1. Need to switch calcite patch autoplace
	6. Carbon
		1. Need to change carbon recipe from sulfuric acid
	7. Cliff explosives
	8. Cliffs (vulcanus style)
	9. Coal liquefaction
	10. Demolishers
	11. Extra coal patch
		1. I could also change this to another ore
	12. Foundry
		2. Need to alter recipe obviously and surface conditions
	13. Lava
		3. Changes where lava tiles are
	14. Speed module 3
	15. Sulfuric acid geyser
	16. Tungsten
		4. Need to change ore location and replace role of carbon
	17. Turbo belts
6. Extras
	1. Carbon ore patch
	2. Extra mixed patch
		1. This could have a few mixed ores, which would also go well with randomizer
	3. Ice ore patch
	4. Random item ore patch
		1. An ore patch used to mine just a random item
	5. Steam lakes
