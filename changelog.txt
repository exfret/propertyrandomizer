    - Recipe ingredients are now randomized
    - Items are now randomized, including ore patches

    - (Still being worked on) Fluids must flow, and so must the fluid boxes (note: Will be finished in the next update probably)

  Changes:
    - Updated the description
  Organization:
    - Refactored a good chunk of the mod to allow for more easily randomizing with a prototype-first method rather than property-first
    - The refactoring will, if anything, probably end up in more errors in the short term, but in the long term development of the mod should be much better
  Balancing:
    - Tile walking speed modifier is less random for tiles that don't normally have a modifier
    - Random crafting/running speeds are now rolled with a simpler, more balanced formula
    - Tweaked the lower/upper limits to be larger on several properties to allow more random experiences
    - Increased the maximum/minimum internal bias

    - A lot of properties were randomized in the wrong direction (i.e.- randomized to "good" with a "bad" bias and vice versa
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.6
Date: 2024.03.08

Date: 2024.03.04
  Balancing:

    - Only randomized magazine sizes with a base size of at least 1, also removed negative bias on magazine size
  Bugfixes:
